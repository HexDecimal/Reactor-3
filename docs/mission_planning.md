# Dynamic storyteller design doc
The storyteller's job changes over the course of a character's life.

## Early-game
The player is dropped into a random situation. Their task it to work their
way out, but in actuality the game is watching how they react and shaping
the content on-the-fly. Right now the player's alignment to major factions
is the only factor decided by this process. Moving forward, opportunities
to expand on this should be noted and explored.

#### So what's the point?
Even if no content-changing events take place, the player is still being led
one way or another based on how they react. We'll need to account for all
possible paths through a situation in order for the player to not end up lost
and afraid.

#### A note about free will
The player can choose to just leg it out of any of these situations. I'm unsure
how to handle this right now, since it is possible to survive with just food and
water.

### Situation 1
The player wakes up next to 1+ dead bodies. The bodies' loot should be
randomized amounts of the LONER loadout. The player is given no items and should
instead pick them up off the ground/bodies. A person arrives and offers to lead
the player to a Loner camp.

Special event: A bandit group comes in to loot the bodies. This only affects the
urgency of the situation (dialog with the guy helping also changes.)

#### Paths
* **A)** The player follows the Loner to a camp -> 
* **B)** The player ignores the Loner -> Unsure (see "A note about free will")

The player is taught:

	* Inventory management.
	* Group (if they
