2013 ARRP TODO LIST

Checks:
	[x] Ensure delete_on_finish (jobs.py) is allowing multiple people to complete the job.
	[x] Is `sight.look` working correctly after the update?
	[?] Would splitting up zone maps help performance?
	[?] Can we delete the `item` key from WORLD_INFO after we update ITEMS?

Fixes:
	[x] Fix jobs menu
	[x] Refresh tile of deleted item
	[ ] ALife get recoil even on idle
	[/] Non-random dialog choices
	[x] Judge dialog impact on `like` and `dislike` instead of gist name
	[ ] Unused function: `jobs.cancel_on`
	[ ] LOS crash on menu exit
	[ ] Item searching in `sight.look`
	[x] Speed-up `sight.scan_surroundings`
		[x] Skip chunk if the chunk before it is invisible
	[ ] Trees need to spawn in the ground a bit
	[?] If we are not compatiable with someone, maybe we can override that with trust?
	[/] Some trees not generating higher than the ground
	[ ] `is_target_of` is terribly inefficient

Cycles:
	[ ] ALife searching for group leader when not found at `last_pos`

Future:
	[x] Re-announce group whenever (alife_group.py)
	[ ] Group relationships
	[/] Bushes/foliage
	[/] Tell about ALife's last position when asked
	[ ] Call out lie when misinforming people on group motive
	[ ] Blowback from weapons
	[ ] Map gen:
		[ ] Dead-end roads
		[x] Driveways/side roads
		[ ] Flowers
		[ ] Road signs
		[ ] Double-wide roads for towns
	[x] `examine_keys`: List of keys to show in examine view
	[ ] Put items in storage

Refactor:
	[ ] `maps.get_chunk` -> `chunks.get_chunk`
	[ ] `maps.enter/leave_chunk` -> `chunks.enter/leave_chunk`

In progress
	[x] Sticky combat pause
	[ ] ALife pause to take cover & reload
		[ ] Potential to have the ALife get close to the player and melee
	[ ] Particle effect for shooting

up_threshold = 50
sampling_down_factor = 10

To get ALife to escape from surrender, generate dijkstra map with all friendly ALife as goals.
Take the score and compare it to the ALife's courage skill. We can translate their skill in courage
to this score to find out whether to run away or not.

If ALife begins dialog while entering or in the surrender state, change dialog based on intimidation
