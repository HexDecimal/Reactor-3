2013 ARRP TODO LIST

Checks:
	[x] Ensure delete_on_finish (jobs.py) is allowing multiple people to complete the job.
	[x] Is `sight.look` working correctly after the update?
	[?] Would splitting up zone maps help performance?
	[?] Can we delete the `item` key from WORLD_INFO after we update ITEMS?

Fixes:
	[x] Fix jobs menu
	[x] Refresh tile of deleted item
	[ ] ALife get recoil even on idle
	[/] Non-random dialog choices
	[x] Judge dialog impact on `like` and `dislike` instead of gist name
	[ ] Unused function: `jobs.cancel_on`
	[ ] LOS crash on menu exit
	[ ] Item searching in `sight.look`
	[x] Speed-up `sight.scan_surroundings`
		[x] Skip chunk if the chunk before it is invisible
	[ ] Trees need to spawn in the ground a bit

Cycles:
	[ ] ALife searching for group leader when not found at `last_pos`

Future:
	[x] Re-announce group whenever (alife_group.py)
	[ ] Group relationships
	[/] Bushes/foliage
	[/] Tell about ALife's last position when asked
	[ ] Call out lie when misinforming people on group motive
	[ ] Blowback from weapons
	[ ] Map gen:
		[ ] Dead-end roads
		[x] Driveways/side roads
		[ ] Flowers

Refactor:
	[ ] `maps.get_chunk` -> `chunks.get_chunk`
	[ ] `maps.enter/leave_chunk` -> `chunks.enter/leave_chunk`

Maybe I'm a fringe case, but I knew what I wanted to do with my life many years before the idea of career planning was introduced: I wanted to program. This would evolve into wanting to program computer games, but I won't get caught up in semantics. I knew what I needed to learn and I was aware of the various paths I thought I could take in order to get there - one of which, was college.

I didn't buy into high school and wanted out almost immediately upon entering. As luck would have it, I was able to break out my last two years and attend vocational school - then, I thought, I would actual learn something relevant from an instructor who cared and wanted to teach, and was passionate about the things I felt similarly about. Instead of the structured learning environment I wanted, I ended up in complete limbo for two years, learning from my own research and peers.

College would be different, I thought, and I assumed I'd spend the entirety of my four years swimming in meaningful academic work; I would enter with a subset of knowledge and exit with enough information to nurture a lifetime of my own research. My professors would be interesting and excited to teach, network, and further my understanding of Computer Science.

I've had a CS instructor blindly copy and butcher lectures from another professor to the point where no lesson could be learned. A tenured professor left class and never came back, and the same one gave us an English lecture once. A professor announced everyone would pass the class regardless of performance the first week of class. An instructor needed help using computer software he was teaching us how to use. Someone else needed assistance from a student to correct the bugs in his code.

I learned to start tuning out a long time ago. If that actually affected my performance in any way, then I wouldn't be maintaining an A average in my CS classes across the past 2 years. I don't know everything, and that's what really scares me, because I always assumed that's what college was for: a place where I'd learn everything I'd need to know in order to be successful. But I don't, and I sit here at 2 in the morning trudging through another irrelevant Math course taught by a professor who has to accept that the teacher before him failed to teach all the material needed to succeed, but has to assign work based on stuff we missed out on just so he can show the department, "Hey, I tried!" and cover his own rear-end.

I can sit here and complain for hours. The CS program is a mess. I have an online class taught by the head of the department himself, and it's a disorganized disaster. We're, what, three weeks in? Four? I've lost count already. I don't know what book I need. All I know is that he's yet to meet his timeline and follow through with anything other than a narrated powerpoint presentation and an email warning us that there will be a quiz soon. Of course, that was a week or so ago and we still haven't heard anything about it.

I've talked about dropping out,
